# simple-bosh-release

## What on earth is this?

This is a very simple bosh relese for a static webpage hosted by `apache2` server. It has only one job and only one package. 
This is as simple as it gets. You can only deploy it on bosh-lite, so you won't need to generate the deployment manifest and
deal with complex parameter substitution and merging stubs and templates. If you want to grasp the very basic things about `bosh`
then read on - we will be building the simplest release in the world step by step, explaining the concepts, starting from scratch.
